3rdparty install
------------------

The 3rdparty build system requires CMake.
Get it from: http://www.cmake.org.

Some build configurations requires python for bootstrapping and setup.
Get it from: http://www.python.org.

On macOS Cataline the Command Line Tools needs to be installed, not just Xcode.
Get Xcode from AppStore.
Get Command Line Tools from "Preferences > Downloads > Command Line Tools", press Install.

Qt is used to build apps.
http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.15/5.15.1/single/qt-everywhere-src-5.15.1.tar.xz

    Make sure you download the .tar.xz unix formatted single archive

    To build for 3rdparty first build base libraries and configure Qt

    ./configure -prefix $(path)/3rdparty/build/macosx.debug 
                -libdir $(path)/git/3rdparty/build/macosx.debug/lib 
                -opensource 
                -confirm-license 
                -system-libpng 
                -system-libjpeg 
                -system-zlib 
                -skip qtactiveqt
                -skip qtandroidextras
                -skip qtconnectivity
                -skip qtgamepad
                -skip qtlocation
                -skip qtlottie
                -skip qtpurchasing
                -skip qtsensors
                -skip qtspeech
                -skip qtvirtualkeyboard
                -skip qtwayland
                -skip qtwebchannel
                -skip qtwebengine
                -skip qtwebglplugin
                -skip qtwebsockets
                -skip qtwebview
                -I$(path)/git/3rdparty/build/macosx.debug/include 
                -L$(path)/git/3rdparty/build/macosx.debug/lib &&
    make install


Building 3rdparty on Linux and OS X
-----------------------------------

The 3rdparty library can be built from the top directory by typing 
make. Advanced users can use CMake directly, see CMakeLists.txt.

The build will create both a build and a dist directory. The build directory
contains both libraries and binary files suitable for development and test 
while the dist directory contains the final library files for distribution.
Only includes, libraries and pkgconfig files will be copied to the dist 
directory.

For both the build and dist directory a platform directory will be
created with the name of the platform you are building for (e.g. linux,
macosx or win).

See the MANIFEST file for the main projects and their dependencies.


Running make
------------

Make targets you should know about:

    make                      Build all projects for development and test in 
			                  'build/platform'
    make debug                Build all projects with debugging symbols when
			                  possible.
    make clean                Get rid of all the temporary files in 'build/platform'.
    make help                 Print all the make options

Additionally, a few helpful modifiers alter some build-time options:

    make verbose=0 ...        Show all compilation commands
    make build_libs=1 ...     Build libraries
    make build_viewers=1 ...  Build viewers
    make build_autotools=1 ...Build autotools
    make build_media=1 ...    Build media

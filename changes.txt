* OIIO, support field3d and lib raw.

Future ideas (as of Jan 1 2014)
-------------------------------

3rdparty ideas:

* Win, use MSBuild + existing project vcproj files.
  See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311(v=vs.85).aspx

* Docs, add 3rdparty doc index.

* Python binding, make sure all binding are built correct. Add build_python?

* VFX platform compliant - add glibc to platforms.
